These repository accompany my Bachelor Thesis offering a wide range of experiments that I carreid out to support the conjectures stated in the manuscript.

## 1st level of experiments (representation space) : 

Compare Representation Level metrics between different Networks (of the same file) trained with different seeds and on different disjoint subsets of a dataset.

## 2nd level of experiments (weight space) :

I study the Linear Mode Connectivty phenomena, inspired by ...

## 3rd level of experiments (representation space) : 

I study the Model Stitching capabilities, inspired by ...
